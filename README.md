## About The Project
This project uses React.JS for front end and Ethereum smart contracts for storing the IPFS hash on a blockchain. Below is the entire process from selecting file to uploading it to ipfs and displaying it on the website

* **File selection:**  You can click on the chose file button to select any image you want. 
* **Capturing file:**  The server then captures the file and converts it into a buffer.
* **Submitting:**  After file capture, once you click on the submit button, the server uploads the file to IPFS and saves the hash it receives from IPFS API.
* **Saving hash on Blockchain:**  Once the IPFS hash is received, server pushes the hash onto an Ethereum compatible Blockchain.
* **Verification:**  Once the hash is on Blockchain, client then verifies the account connected to the Blockchain and retrieves the hash.
* **Update Image:**  Once client verifies the account holder through Meta Mask, image updates on the client.

### Built With
This project uses the following software and languages
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)
* [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [WebStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
* [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/)
* [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Here is the list of all the prerequisites you would need to install on your system in order to run this device
* Node.js v10.15.3
```sh
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```
* npm
```sh
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
```
* Truffle
```sh
https://www.trufflesuite.com
```

* Additional build tools are required to be able to run media keys on windows. Run these commands from an 
administrative shell to install software dependencies:
<br/><br/>**_Note:_** _You need to install windows build tools version 4.0 or higher_ <br/><br/>
```sh
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
npm install -g node-gyp
```

### Installation
1. Add all dependencies using npm
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
2. Open Ganache and run a private Blockchain

3. Run Truffle to add smart contract to the Blockchain
    ```sh
    truffle migrate --reset
    ```
    You will get the following feedback from console: 
    <br/><br/>
    ![Port Image](assets/migrate.PNG?raw=true "Port")
    
4. Run server to start the React.JS client
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
**_Note:_** _You need to keep running Ganache Blockchain for the app to work. Please go through the deployment below to start using your client._

## Deployment

Run 
```sh
npm build
```
You need to connect to Rinkeby  or Ropsten test network if you do not want to spend any money on Ethereum smart contracts.
